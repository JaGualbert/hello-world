# hello-world
Beginning project for a github newbie.
I am a coding newbie developing the skills necessary for a career in web development. This is my first use of github; so any reviewers of my work can send feedback. 
Currently I am completing projects for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Development certificate.
Next will be moving on to JavaScript.
